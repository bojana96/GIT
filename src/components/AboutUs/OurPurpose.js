                In some places there are still gender stereotypes that make it hard enough for women,
            </p>
            <p>
                but in tough times how women treat other women matters even more.
            </p>

                Our goal is to support women that need help to make changes in the world
            <p>
                and make their life easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to help us support those in need you can donate or if you know someone </p>
            <p>
                who need help let us know.
